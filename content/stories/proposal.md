# Origin
So jim and i met for the first time in 2017 through a mutual friend, Sam. So we met on the way to a climbing trip. Our friend Sam organized the trip because I was leaving Illinois and I had never been to this amazing climbing place in Kentucky called red reiver gorge. Many of the people on this trip barely knew each other. So it was a weekend of getting to know one another. Jim didn't realize this and just ignored meagan the whole weekend. The part of that trip that really sticks out to me is the car ride down where Jim and I spent 7 hour laughing together. Where he also told me we could never be friends because I didn't like running. That is a story for a different day. Although I guess he was right, we never were friends. Just awesomely magnificent lovers. At the end of that really fun climbing weekend, or shortly after Meagan abandoned Jim and went back to new york. It would be almost two years before we spoke again. 

It was only natural that with mutual interests of climbing and ice climbing and facebook that our paths would cross again. Jim really forced it though, let's be honest. In 2019, "I really wish I could have been wish you guys this year". That was the first message that we exchanged in nearly two years (since Meagan always forgets about the time we went climbing at FA just before she left for knew york). and it jumped started conversations about rock climbing, ice climbing, camping, and sex. (not sex, but jim was thinking it). That evolved into planning a trip to that same climbing place from years prior, Red River Gorge. Jim, being the gentleman, offered to let Meagan share his tent as she was flying in from knew york and could not bring hers. Sex ensued. 

# Rising Action
Don't skip the france romance. So much texting and such.

Over the following six months, much sex ensued, I mean we planned trips between new york and chicago. Jim was a bum living on a floor with cats. Jim survived a weekend supporting Meagan through her half-ironman race. Meagan survived a full weekend with Jim's lovely family who love her and she loves them now... 

Don't skip how good Jim was with lelehune and laiku. The hula stuff is important. Don't forget Thanksgiving race and family time. 

# Leaps of faith
Meagan decided Jim was the bEEEEZ kneez, so Meagan left her job in knew york and moved back to Chicago and stayed with her maid of honor, katherine so that she could be a mere one mile from jim's shanty house. BIG ASS RISK YO! You would think that was the biggest risk one would make for a relationship yearly on, but 2 months later Jim bought a Van to live in full time, IN THE MIDDLE OF FUCKING WINTER, and asked Meagan to join him. Then we did actually end up doing the ice fest thing finally. YAR. This was the first time she said yes (also after a delay). The van was small and cold and the best thing ever because meagan was there. We did get lucky though, we moved into an apartment together just before being stuck in a studio apartment during covid. And by stuck I mean, fuck ya, she rocks, only her for months. WOOOO.

# Headed to New York
After a few months of covid love, we decided to spend some time in knew york to visit her family. ```hmhm-giggle``` I got to see Jim bond with my family, particularly Andrew and his robots.
